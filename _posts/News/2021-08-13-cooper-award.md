I am grateful to receive the [James G. Cooper Early Professional Award](https://americanornithology.org/awards-grants/early-professional/james-g-cooper-early-professional-award/) 
from the [American Ornithological Society](https://americanornithology.org) (AOS).
It was wonderful to present my research as a plenary talk at the AOS & SCO-SOC joint meeting on August 10, 2021.
I hope to post a recording of my talk at some point in the near future.
